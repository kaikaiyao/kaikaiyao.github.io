description: Outside of research, I have been deeply involved in classical music, which has been a significant part of my life since a very young age. I started learning the piano at the age of 6 and began studying woodwinds at 9, specializing in the oboe. I earned the 'Shanghai Musicians Association Oboe Performance Level' certificate (equivalent to the ABRSM Diploma Grade) in middle school, the same year that I won the first place in the youth category of oboe at the Shanghai's Voice International Music Festival. I have served as principal oboist for various orchestras, including the Shanghai Nanyang Model High School Symphony Orchestra (one of the top youth orchestras in China), the Shanghai Student Symphony Orchestra, and the Fudan University Symphony Orchestra. Besides oboe, I also enjoy playing the piano and performing classical singing as a tenor.
