My name is Kai Yao, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My research focuses on **Privacy Preserving Machine Learning, Fairness in Machine Learning, and Security of Machine Learning**, and my advisor is [Dr. Marc Juarez](https://mjuarezm.github.io/).

I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) and my Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). At Johns Hopkins, my research focused on Deep Learning applications in cellular biophysics. I was privileged to explore the depths of Statistics and Machine Learning through both coursework and research.

Before joining the University of Edinburgh, I also gained many years of valuable industry experience in AI. I worked as an AI Frameworks Engineer and Domain Lead at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html), and as an AI Algorithm Engineer at [Huawei](https://www.huawei.com/en/). I specialized in model acceleration and DL frameworks optimization, emphasizing mixed precision and model quantization techniques.

### News
- Our paper *SoK: What Makes Private Learning Unfair?* has been accepted at the [3rd conference of IEEE Secure and Trustworthy ML (SaTML'25)](https://satml.org/accepted-papers/)!
